"""
Serve an underwrite session so the page and the walk stay in step, both ways.

Page to agent: POST /act carries the reviewer's action, and the agent parks on
/await until one arrives.

Agent to page: POST /status carries what the agent is doing right now, which is
the half that files alone cannot express. "Applying your accept", "running
tests", "parked waiting on you" all look identical on disk.

Both directions land on /events, a Server-Sent Events stream, so the page never
polls. A watcher thread covers writes nobody announced.

Loopback only, and no path is ever taken from a request: every read and write is
a fixed name inside the session directory. Binding loopback is not by itself
authentication, so requests are checked for the two ways a browser reaches a
local port from somewhere else: see Handler.forged.

Exit 1  usage error, or the port could not be bound
