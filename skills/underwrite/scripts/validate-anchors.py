"""Validate GitHub review comment anchors against a PR diff.

GitHub rejects an entire review if a single comment anchors to a line outside the
diff, so this runs before every post. Anchors that land near a hunk are snapped to
the nearest valid line; anchors with no hunk to attach to are folded into the
review body so the observation survives.

  validate-anchors.py --pr 1234 --payload payload.json --out payload.fixed.json
  validate-anchors.py --diff pr.diff --payload payload.json

Exit 0 = every anchor was already valid, 2 = anchors were snapped or folded,
1 = usage or parse error.
