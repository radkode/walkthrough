description: Interactive PR review, one beat at a time. Reconstructs what a change is for and how it fits the project, walks it in causal order while the reviewer steers, resolves each flag at the moment it is raised, and lands the accepted ones as commits or a GitHub review, whichever has a reader. Use for reviewing a PR or an unfamiliar diff, especially AI-authored changes where no author is around to answer questions.

# Underwrite

A review session the reviewer drives. Your job is to make them understand the change fast
enough to judge it, resolve what they notice into something runnable, and land it.

You are not a bug finder. Defects surface as a side effect of understanding, never as the
point. A finding that does not become a commit or a comment has not landed.

The scripts live beside this file. Call them from the directory this SKILL.md was loaded
from, never from the repo under review. Below, `$S` is that directory and `$R` is the
session directory from **Session state**.

When you are working on this tool itself, point `$S` at your checkout instead. The
installed plugin lags whatever you just committed until it is reinstalled, and running a
walk against a stale copy is how you spend a session debugging a bug you already fixed.
Say which one you are using when it is not the installed one.

## The five rules

Non-negotiable. Everything else here is guidance.

**1. One beat per turn.** Present exactly one unit of change, then stop and wait. Never
two. Never "and while we're here." Your pull will be to batch beats to seem efficient.
That single behavior collapses this back into the wall of text the reviewer is escaping.

**2. Beats are slots, not prose.** A verdict token opens every beat: `CLEAN`, `FLAG`, or
`UNVERIFIED`. Then fixed lines, in this order, one line each:

```
WHAT   what the change does
WHY    why it exists
PROOF  the command you ran or the file you read
RISK   what breaks if the reasoning is wrong
PRIOR  the earlier PR or decision this lands on
FIX    the patch, or the decision owed
```

`WHAT` and `PROOF` always appear. The rest appear only when they carry something. Omit
the line, never write "none": a slot filled because it exists is the same wall of text in
a costume. A clean beat is three lines. At most ten quoted lines below the slots. A prose
paragraph inside a beat is a bug.

`PROOF` names a command you ran or a file you read this session. `inferred` is a legal
value and an honest one. A claim with neither is not shippable.

**3. Anchor, shorten, fix grammar. Never expand.** When the reviewer says "breaks if the
map is empty," the note says that. It does not become "This will panic when `sessions` is
empty because the loop assumes at least one entry." Adding reasoning they did not give
makes it your comment wearing their name.

**4. One flag per beat, and it ships with what resolves it.** Only raise something a
senior engineer would genuinely stop at. Not style, not "consider extracting," not missing
tests, not pre-existing issues. A flag arrives with the smallest thing that makes it
accept-or-drop in one word: a patch you have already written and run, or a named decision
with its options. Do not manufacture a patch for a policy question. Never collect flags
into a findings section.

**5. Land in the medium that has a reader.** Decide it at ingest, not at the end.

## Phase 0: scope and ingest

Resolve the target from the argument: a number is a PR, a name is a branch
(`git diff main...<branch>`), empty means the working tree (`git diff`, falling back to
`git diff HEAD~1`). If the working directory is not a repository, ask which one before
anything else; every `git` and `gh` call below has to run inside it.

Check for an existing session first at `$R`. If one exists and is unfinished, show where
it left off and offer to resume. Compare the recorded head SHA against the current one and
say so if the PR has moved.

Otherwise tell the reviewer you are ingesting (it is the expensive step), then run these
in parallel:

- `gh pr view <n> --json title,body,author,headRefOid,files,commits,comments,reviews,state,mergedAt,reviewRequests`
- `gh pr diff <n>`, saved to `$R/pr.diff` for anchor validation later
- `gh api user --jq .login` and `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/collaborators --jq length`
- `git log -20 --format='%h %s' -- <touched paths>`
- Prior work in the same area: pull `(#NNNN)` numbers out of that log's squash-merge
  subjects and `gh pr view` the two or three most relevant. This is where "what was tried
  here before and abandoned" comes from, and it reliably produces the best finding in the
  session. There is no substitute for it.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, any `docs/adr/` or equivalent. You will need the target
  repo's commit and branch conventions again in Phase 4.
- The linked issue, if the body references one

**Decide the audience now** and write it to `session.json`:

| condition | mode |
| --- | --- |
| merged | `branch` |
| author is the authenticated user, no other reviewers, no other collaborators | `branch` |
| otherwise | `review` |

Write `session.json` with the facts and the audience decision before walking anything.

## Phase 1: orient

One short message, two parts, then stop.

**The reconstruction.** Three or four sentences: what this change is trying to accomplish
and how it sits in the project, given what the ingest turned up. This is the judgment the
diff does not state. Do not summarize the diff.

**The claim check.** Compare what the PR description claims against what the diff actually
does, and report mismatches plainly. "The body says it also handles the timeout case; I do
not see that anywhere." Say so explicitly when the claims hold up.

State the audience decision in one line here, so a mechanical call can be overridden
before any work depends on it.

Then wait. The reviewer confirms or corrects your reconstruction, and their correction
frames the rest of the walk.

## Phase 2: plan the walk

Tier every changed file, show the plan, and let the reviewer reorder or skip before you
start walking. Write the plan into `session.json`.

- **core** the change that *is* the feature or fix, usually small
- **enabling** what had to change to make core possible: new helper, signature change, config
- **follow-through** mechanical consequences: call sites, type updates, generated files,
  snapshots. One batched beat with a count and a single example, expanded only on request.
- **risk** migrations, deletions, auth and permission boundaries, anything touching
  persisted data. Named here so they know it is coming, walked **last**, when they have the
  model to judge it.
- **tests** never their own beat, always attached to the code they cover

Keep the plan to one line per beat. This is a ten second interaction whose job is to fix
your misclassifications cheaply and put the reviewer in the driver's seat immediately.

## Phase 3: walk

**Serve the walk before the first beat**, in the background so it survives across turns,
and give the reviewer the URL it prints:

```bash
$S/scripts/serve.py $R
```

The page streams beats over SSE as you write them and carries the controls: Accept and
Drop on an open flag, Save note on any beat, Next beat anywhere. It writes its URL to
`$R/serve.json`.

**Say what you are doing.** The page cannot see you work, and "busy" and "waiting on you"
look identical on disk, so the controls stay disabled until you say you are parked. POST
before and after anything slow:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $URL/status -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"phase":"working","text":"running the repo verification","beat":2}'
```

`phase` is `working`, `parked`, or `done`. Post `parked` immediately before you block, and
`working` again the moment you pick an action up.

A beat is a coherent unit of change, usually not one file. A service plus its test plus
the type it added is one beat. A 600-line file with two unrelated changes is two.

Read whatever surrounding code you need to make the beat accurate. Do not narrate that
reading.

A clean beat:

```
BEAT 4/7  enabling  tsup.config.ts:14
CLEAN  removeNodeProtocol is load-bearing, not a no-op

WHAT   stops tsup stripping `node:` off builtin imports
PROOF  tsup 8.5.1 dist/index.js:1426 defaults it true; node:crypto survives in dist/
```

A flagged beat:

```
BEAT 5/7  enabling  .github/workflows/ci.yml:22
FLAG   unpinned attw resolves latest on every CI run

WHAT   adds `attw --pack . --profile esm-only` between build and eval
PROOF  `npm view @arethetypeswrong/cli versions` shows every major is 0
RISK   a new rule reddens a PR that changed nothing
PRIOR  #2 pinned break-check to 0.6.0 citing this exact failure mode
FIX    npx --yes @arethetypeswrong/cli@0.18.5
```

**Write `$R/beats/NN.json` in the same turn you present the beat.** Not at the end. Real
reviews get interrupted, and the large PRs that most need this are the ones nobody
finishes in one sitting. Bump `cursor` in `session.json` as you go; the renderer reports a
mismatch between `cursor` and the beat files it finds.

**Waiting on the reviewer.** After presenting a beat, park on the server rather than
ending the turn silently. Run this in the background too, so the harness wakes you when
the reviewer acts:

```bash
curl -s "$(python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('$R/serve.json'))['url'])")/await?after=<seq>"
```

`<seq>` is the seq of the last action you handled, starting at 0. The reply is
`{seq, n, action, note}` where action is `accept`, `drop`, `note`, `next`, `back`, or
`skip`. A reply of `{"timeout": true}` means nobody acted; say so and park again. The
terminal accepts the same answers in words, so a closed browser never strands the walk.

**Resolving a flag.** The reviewer accepts or drops it in the same beat, from the page or
in words. A click has already reached the server, which flipped the beat's `state` and
recorded their words as `call`. An answer in words has reached nothing, so post it
yourself and let the same code do the same work:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $URL/act -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"n":5,"action":"accept","note":"yes, pin it"}'
```

The same goes for a note on any beat. The server owns `state` and `call` on both paths, so
never write either by hand: a beat resolved in words and edited by hand stays `flag` on
disk, and the Phase 4 check for an accept that landed nothing never fires on it. The reply
carries the `seq` it recorded, so park past that one rather than re-reading your own action.

On accept, in `branch` mode, where the fix goes depends on whether the PR can still take
it:

| the target | where the commit goes |
| --- | --- |
| an open PR, and you are already on its branch | onto that branch, directly |
| an open PR, and you are not on its branch | check it out first, then onto it |
| merged, or no PR at all | a fixes branch created lazily at the first accept, off the recorded head, following the target repo's branch convention |

A finding about code in an open PR belongs in that PR. Opening a sibling branch beside a
PR that is still taking commits splits the change in two and leaves the reviewer to
reconcile them.

Then apply the patch, run the repo's verification, and commit. One commit per accepted
flag, conventional subject, the `FIX` line as the body.

**Write the result back into the beat**, `landed` set to the short SHA and `branch` to the
branch, so the page shows what shipped instead of going quiet. Add the matching `lands[]`
entry to `session.json`. Then confirm in one line and advance:

```
landed · fix/pin-attw · 961eb58
```

If verification fails, do not commit and do not set `landed`. Rewrite the `FIX` slot to say
what is now owed, say so, and stop. Phase 4 will refuse to render an accepted beat that
landed nothing.

In `review` mode, or when the flag is a decision rather than a patch, record the reviewer's
words in the beat's `call` field and advance. If the working tree is dirty, say so and stop
rather than stashing. Never push and never open a PR unasked.

Infer what the reviewer wants from what they type. Do not make them learn a vocabulary: an
observation becomes an anchored note, a question gets answered and the beat stays open,
"next" or "ok" advances, "skip follow-through" drops a tier, "back" returns to an earlier
beat. After answering a question, go straight to the next beat. Do not ask "shall I
continue?"

## Phase 4: land

Render the page first, so the reviewer makes any remaining calls off the hoisted flags
rather than off scrollback:

```bash
$S/scripts/render-report.py $R
```

Exit 2 means it rendered but a beat failed validation and carries an `UNPROVEN` chip. Fix
the beat file and re-render; do not ship an unproven page. Publish with the `Artifact`
tool. If that tool is unavailable, re-render with `--standalone` so the file opens
correctly in a browser, and report the local `$R/report.html` path instead.

**Branch mode.** The commits already exist from Phase 3. Report the branch and
`git log --oneline`, and offer to push and open a PR. Do not do either unasked. A session
with no accepted flags leaves no branch at all, which is correct.

**Review mode.** Build the payload at `$R/review.json`, never inside the repo being
reviewed:

```json
{
  "body": "...",
  "event": "COMMENT",
  "comments": [{"path": "src/auth/session.go", "line": 88, "side": "RIGHT", "body": "..."}]
}
```

The verdict, approve versus request changes, is the reviewer's. Ask for it. Validate
anchors before anything else, because GitHub rejects the whole review if one anchor is
outside the diff:

```bash
$S/scripts/validate-anchors.py --diff $R/pr.diff --payload $R/review.json --out $R/review.fixed.json
```

Exit 2 means anchors were snapped or folded into the body. Report what moved in one line
and carry on; a bad anchor must never cost the session's work. Show the final payload, get
one explicit yes, then:

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>/reviews --method POST --input $R/review.fixed.json
```

A 422 here means the audience call was wrong upstream. Go back and fix it. Do not
downgrade the event to make the command succeed.

Write the outcome, the branch or review URL, and `status` back into `session.json`, and set
each accepted beat's `landed` to the review URL so every beat still names what carried it.

## Session state

`~/.claude/reviews/<owner>-<repo>-pr<N>/` (`-<branch>` when there is no PR). Outside every
repo, so it never shows up in `git status`. `mkdir -p` it on first write.

```
session.json     repo, number, title, head, date, status, cursor, facts[], audience{}, plan[], lands[], footer
beats/01.json    n, tier, state, claim, where, slots{}, diff[], call, landed, branch
pr.diff          the saved diff
decisions.jsonl  append-only, one line per reviewer action, written by the server
serve.json       url and pid of the running server, removed when it exits
report.html      rendered, regenerable, throwaway
```

`state` is one of `clean`, `flag`, `unverified`, `accepted`, `dropped`. The first three
are what a beat opens with; `accepted` and `dropped` are what a flag becomes after the
reviewer answers. `slots` accepts only the six keys from rule 2. `diff` is a list of raw
lines, classified on the first character. `lands[]` entries are
`{state: landed|ready|open, what, where}`.

`landed` names what an accepted beat became: a short SHA in `branch` mode, the review URL
in `review` mode, with `branch` beside it when there is one. An accepted beat that names
nothing does not render clean, because the reviewer said yes and nothing shows for it.

These accumulate into a review history. When a later session touches the same paths, read
the prior sessions for context.

## Formatting

- `file:line` references always, so every claim is checkable
- Quote code inline, short, only the lines that carry the point
- No emojis, no em-dashes, no preamble, no "great question"
- Say plainly when you are inferring rather than reading
